\begin{prop*}[Autobiography Proof] 
    For all real numbers $x$ and $y$, if $x+y = 9$ and $2x-y = 6$, then $x = 5$ and $y = 4$. 
\end{prop*}

\begin{proof}
    Let $x$ and $y$ be real numbers. Consider the linear system of equations
    \begin{align}
        x+y &= 9 \label{eq1} \\
        2x-y &= 6 \label{eq2}.
    \end{align}
    
    % Explain how you got to your solution in your autobiography. For instance, you might start with (remove the "%" to uncomment the next line):
    % Solving Equation~\eqref{eq1} for $y$ we obtain $y = 9-x$.
    % But if you did something different in your autobiography, you'll want to do that instead!
    % To reference an equation, use \eqref{}.
    Taking equation \eqref{eq1} and multiplying it by (-2) while solving for $y$ yields $ y=4$ through the process of elimination. Using $y=4$, we substitute it into either equations in search of $x$, leading to an answer of $x=5$. Therefore, given the linear system of equations \eqref{eq1} and \eqref{eq2}, $x=5$ and $y=4$ for all real numbers $x$ and $y$.
